  <h3>General <span>safety and conduct</span></h3>
  <p>
    <span>To ensure the quiet and safe enjoyment of badmington by all members, Club members are expected to adhere to the "general" Badmington Club Code of Conduct.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
    The points listed below are simply a matter of common courtesy extended to and expected by most badmington players:
  </p>
  <dl>
    <dt>Calling lines</dt>
    <dd>
      Calling lines is often a controversial issue. However, if you're in doubt as to whether the bird is in, on the line, or out, you should call it in favour of your opponent. Be courteous and accept line calls in the spirit that most players offer them: honestly.
    </dd>
    <dt>Courtesy please</dt>
    <dd>
      In general, be considerate to your fellow players. Accept games with lower calibre players so they learn to improve too. Donï¿½t be afraid/timid to ask someone to play with you.
    </dd>
    <dt>Sportsmanship</dt>
    <dd>
      No one likes a sore loser. Members are expected to shake hands unconditionally at the end of every game. Without Exception.
    </dd>
    <dt>Walking between courts</dt>
    <dd>
      Please be aware of games in progress when you are walking by or between the courts.Wait until the rally is finished.
    </dd>
    <dt>Kids</dt>
    <dd>
      As we expect kids to enjoy their stay while the adults play, parents are advised to keep the little ones out of the Badminton court at all times to avoid any accidents.

      One special day in the year is set aside for the annual Christmas Party. Generally arranged for the kids and all club members.
